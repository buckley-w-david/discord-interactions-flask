# meta-bot

This project demonstrates creating commands dynamically at runtime.

I'm not sure why you'd ever want to do that, but you can.

## Running

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/buckley-w-david/discord-interactions-flask.git
$ cd discord-interactions-flask/examples/repl-bot
$ export DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY="..."
$ export DISCORD_CLIENT_ID="..."
$ export DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET="..."
$ poetry install
$ FLASK_APP=repl_bot poetry run flask run
```

Setup
==========

Install
-------

I didn't realize until this package already had a decent amount of work into it that `Someone else already had the same idea <https://github.com/Breq16/discord-interactions-flask>`_. As such, this package isn't on PyPI. You'll have to grab it from GitHub.

.. code-block:: bash

   poetry add "git+https://github.com/buckley-w-david/discord-interactions-flask.git"
